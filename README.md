# ALX Capstone Project: Portfolio Showcase

## Project Overview

Welcome to my ALX Capstone project! In this repository, I have developed a dynamic portfolio website to showcase the skills I've acquired in HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, MySQL, JavaScript, API integration, and Git version control. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my proficiency in these technologies, highlighting my ability to create responsive web applications, work with databases, handle server-side scripting, integrate APIs, and collaborate using Git.

## Project Features

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

- **Frontend Technologies:**
  - **HTML & CSS:** The website's structure and visual presentation are created using HTML and CSS, ensuring accessibility and a visually appealing user interface.
  - **JavaScript:** Interactive elements and dynamic content are implemented using JavaScript, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.

- **Backend Technologies:**
  - **Python & Flask:** Server-side scripting is handled using Python and Flask, allowing for dynamic content generation and interaction with the MySQL database.
  - **MySQL:** The portfolio website utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage data efficiently.
  - **API Integration:** External APIs are integrated to showcase real-time data or enhance specific features of the portfolio.

- **Version Control:**
  - **Git:** The project is version-controlled using Git, enabling collaboration, tracking changes, and ensuring codebase integrity.
